For this program you will perform a set of conversions from Fahrenheit to Celsius or vice versa.
The user will first enter an F to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius or a C to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
Then the user will enter three integer values. 
The first integer will be the lower temperature.
The second integer will be the higher temperature.
And the third integer will be the incremental temperature change.
Your program will then convert all of the temperatures within that range based on the incremental temperature change.
Here are a few sample executions.

```
Would you like convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius (F) or Celsius to Fahrenheit (C)? F
Enter the lower Fahrenheit temperature: 20
Enter the higher Fahrenheit temperature: 40
Enter the incremental temperature change: 2
20F = -6.67C
22F = -5.56C
24F = -4.44C
26F = -3.33C
28F = -2.22C
30F = -1.11C
32F = 0.00C
34F = 1.11C
36F = 2.22C
38F = 3.33C
40F = 4.44C

Would you like convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius (F) or Celsius to Fahrenheit (C)? C
Enter the lower Celsius temperature: 10
Enter the higher Celsius temperature: 30
Enter the incremental temperature change: 3
10C = 50.00F
13C = 55.40F
16C = 60.80F
19C = 66.20F
22C = 71.60F
25C = 77.00F
28C = 82.40F
```

You can assume that the values entered will be of the correct type (a character for the type of conversion and integers for the other three values), but you cannot assume anything about the values, so put the appropriate error checks into your code.
